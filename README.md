Data and R code for processing, analyzing & visualizing results after running https://github.com/stenglein-lab/viral_variant_caller pipeline.

Three cohorts of cats (N=23) were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 or infected via cat-to-cat contact transmission. Full viral genomes were recovered from RNA obtained from nasal washes 1-3 days post-infection, and analyzed for within-host viral variants. 

Raw sequence data is publicly available in NCBI SRA database under Bioprojects PRJNA704947 and 
PRJNA842572.
